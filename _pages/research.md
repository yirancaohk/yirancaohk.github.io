### Working Papers

- [Search and Competition in Expert Markets.]([https://yirancaohk.github.io/files/Carol_jmp.pdf]) _with Yongmin Chen, Yucheng Ding, and Tianle Zhang_, 2022, R&R at **RAND Journal of Economics**. [Job Market Paper]
  
<span style="font-size:0.8em; text-align: justify;"> We develop a model in which consumers sequentially search experts for recommendations and prices to treat a problem, and experts simultaneously compete in these two dimensions. Consumers have either zero or a positive search cost. In equilibrium, experts may “cheat” by recommending an unnecessary treatment with positive probabilities, prices follow distributions that depend on a consumer’s problem type and the treatment, and consumers search with Bayesian belief updating about their problem types. Remarkably, as search cost decreases, both expert cheating and prices can increase stochastically. However, if search cost is sufficiently small, competition will force all experts to behave honestly.</span>

- Partial Vertical Integration, and Market Foreclosure. _with Ping Lin_, 2022.

<span style="font-size:0.8em; text-align: justify;"> This paper investigates whether a partial vertical merger results in market foreclosure, and how the integrating firm's foreclosure strategy affects consumer welfare, in a successive duopoly setting. The result suggests that the magnitude of partial ownership shares has a significant impact on the integrated firm's incentive in foreclosing competitors. The integrated upstream firm, in particular, chooses input foreclosure if and only if the ownership stake is significant enough, and the integrated downstream firm executes customer foreclosure if and only if the ownership stake is intermediate. Furthermore, consumers benefit the most when the ownership share is intermediate. </span>
  
- Killer Acquisition in Vertically Related Industries. _with Ping Lin, and Tianle Zhang_, 2023.
  
<span style="font-size:0.8em; text-align: justify;"> Incumbent firms may acquire start-ups to eliminate potential competition without intending to develop new technology (killer acquisitions). We develop a model to examine the incentives and welfare implications of killer acquisitions under different market structures: vertical separation and integration. Our model focuses on the competition between an incumbent upstream firm and a startup with the potential to develop superior technology, where the incumbent has the option to acquire the startup and decide whether to pursue the superior technology. We find that killer acquisitions are more likely when the cost of developing the superior technology is moderate under both vertical separation and vertical integration. However, these acquisitions lead to a welfare loss only when the development cost is relatively low. Comparing vertical integration and separation, the probability of killer acquisition is higher (lower) when the incumbent firm has a greater (smaller) chance of successfully developing the superior technology.</span>

- Killer Acquisitions: Competition Test and Remedies. _with Ping Lin_, 2023.
  
<span style="font-size:0.8em; text-align: justify;"> Killer acquisitions have become a big competition concern globally recently. We establish a synergy-effect test for evaluating the competitive impact of start-up acquisitions. An acquisition is welfare-enhancing if and only if the level of synergy effect exceeds a threshold which is proportionate to the unilateral effect in the post-R\&D product market. A Commit-to-Continue remedy can effectively eliminate KA transactions, while a product-line divestiture remedy can eradicate welfare-reducing non-KA transactions. We also consider voluntary divestitures by the acquiring firm in a Cournot setting. We show that KA is considerably less likely to occur due to a reversed merger paradox effect. </span>
